# Prescription Manager and Reminder


DEMO: <a>https://drremindermedhacks.herokuapp.com/</a>


IMPORTANT!!!
- You can only upload images <1 MB (because we used the free version of an API)
- If you get an error after uploading images, it's because the images are not high quality enough.
- Another reason: it's because the free version allows a max of 25,000 requests a month and we've probably already used up all the requests.


IMPROVEMENTS
- Improve frontend because it only looks good on desktops right now. Will need to optimize for mobile phones.
- Improve NLP algorithm that parses through OCR-scanned prescription to create intake routine (right now it's hard coded).
- Improve OCR capabilities using a better OCR API without limitations.
